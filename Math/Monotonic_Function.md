#### Monotonic Function / Monotonicity

A **monotonic function** is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order.

More concretely, if you had an ordered set S1 of points:
S1 = {1, 3, 6, 10, 14}
applying the monotonic function f(x) to each point would result in a set S2 that preserved OR reversed the order of the original set.

e.g.
S2 = {2, 4, 12, 20, 28}
or
S2 = {-1, -3, -6, -10, -14}

but NOT

S2 = {1, -3, 6, -10, 14}

Graphically speaking, a **monotonically increasing function** will show a line where the y-value goes up as the x does. A **monotonically decreasing function** will show a line where the y-value decreases as the x-value increases.

If the y-value ever "crosses over" its own value as x increases, then you know it's not monotonic.
