# Learn Something

Inspired by [Kevin Peng](http://kpeng.ca)'s [Learn-Something-Everyday](https://github.com/kevintpeng/Learn-Something-Every-Day) repo... but without the everyday, as I don't want to be compelled to take electronic notes on everything I read about/try to learn (as I strongly believe that that is in fact *not* the best way to learn).

These are my personal notes on things that I've explored. They will mostly be related to tech/software engineering, with meanderings into music theory, audio engineering, philosophy, and whatever else I'm currently into. Of course, the list of topics will grow as I do!
