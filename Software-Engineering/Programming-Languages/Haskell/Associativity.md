# Haskell Associativity

Along with precedence, Haskell defines _associativity_ of operators. This determines whether an expression containing multiple uses of an operator is evaluated from left to right, or right to left.

If you run **:info** in **ghci** on an operator, you can see whether an operator is left or right associative.

**infixr** means right associative, **infixl** means left associative.
