# Literate Programming

**Literate Programming** is a programming paradigm that was created by Donald Knuth.

In Literate Programming, a program is seen as an explanation of program logic in a _natural language_, with interspersed pieces of source code and macros. It puts humans and the flow of logical thought first, and the order imposed by computers second.

Literate programs are written as uninterrupted exposition of logic like the text of an essay, in which macros are included to hide abstractions and traditional source code.

From the **literate source**, literate programming tools are then used to obtain 2 representations of the source file:

**Tangled code**, which is suitable for further compilation or execution by the computer, and

**Woven code**, which is for viewing as formatted documentation.
