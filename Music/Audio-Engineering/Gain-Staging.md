# Gain Staging

**Gain staging** is when you make sure that the level of the signal at each point of the signal chain is "gained" appropriately.

Or, in other words, you want to **maintain the same perceived volume level** at the output of _every_ device in the chain! (e.g. reverb -> flanger -> compressor)

Gain staging lets us assess if the device is making things sound better, or just lounder. For some reason, we often think things sound better when amplified.
