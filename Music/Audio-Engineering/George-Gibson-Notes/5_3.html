<b><i><font size=+1>5.3 Inference in Reflections</font></i></b>
<p>Another kind of interference that is rather easy to observe is interference
though reflection. In the previous section we considered situations where
there are two sources of waves, as there must be at least two waves to
have interference. However, there are times when one wave can produce two
waves and those two waves then interfere. The most common example of this
is interference through reflection. Consider a pair of glasses that have
what is called an "anti-reflection coating". This is a very thin transparent
coating placed on top of an eyeglass lens:
<p><img SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section5_3/395x174xImage175.gif.pagespeed.ic.J8owADtM2H.png" height=174 width=395>
<p>Normally, a piece of glass, like an eyeglass lens reflects a fair amount
of light, about 4%. Although this may seems small, it can be distracting
when talking to someone wearing glasses, especially if there are bright
lights around. The reflection is particularly noticeable in photographs
or on television because of the bright flash or camera lights. These reflections
would cause problems within a camera, as a camera lens is not a simple
lens like in eyeglasses. Rather, a good camera lens is actually composed
of up to ten individual lenses. If each lens reflected some light, there
would be a lot of light bouncing around inside the camera, washing out
the photograph. Thus, scientists came up with a way to suppress the reflections
using the principle of interference.
<p>Looking at the figure above, a single wave comes down and strikes the eyeglass 
  lens. A small part of the wave reflects off of the first surface – the top of 
  the coating. The rest of the wave is transmitted. However, a small part of the 
  transmitted wave then reflects off of the lens, itself. Thus, two waves are 
  now traveling up. These two waves can interfere and we want to know whether 
  there will be constructive or destructive interference. 
<p>Using the method discussed in the previous section, there are always two parts 
  to a question like this. The first part involves using the figure to determine 
  the difference in path length between the observer and the two waves. To do 
  this, let's enlarge the figure above: 
<p><img SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section5_3/325x286xImage180.gif.pagespeed.ic.SFxXOkLDks.png" height=286 width=325>
<p>Again, we see that one of the waves reflects off of the coating and
travels straight to the observer. The second wave travels through the coating
before reflecting off of the lens itself. If the thickness of the coating
is called "t", then the second wave travels a distance 2t compared to the
first wave. Remember it has to travel through the coating in each direction.
So, the difference in path length traveled by the two waves, R<sub>2 </sub>-
R<sub>1</sub>, is just 2t.
<p>The second step in the analysis is recalling the conditions for constructive
and destructive interference. In the path length difference, R<sub>2 </sub>-
R<sub>1</sub>, is a multiple of a wavelength, n<font face="Symbol">l</font>
, then there will be constructive interference. If R<sub>2 </sub>- R<sub>1</sub>
= &frac12;<font face="Symbol">l</font> + n<font face="Symbol">l</font>
, then there will be destructive interference.
<p>In this example, we want to suppress the reflection, so we want the two waves 
  to cancel each other out, or, we want destructive interference. The simplest 
  condition for destructive interference is R<sub>2 </sub>- R<sub>1</sub> = &frac12;<font face="Symbol">l</font> 
  . We can now bring these two pieces of information together: 
<p>Path length difference from diagram:
<p>R<sub>2 </sub>- R<sub>1</sub> = 2t.
<p>Path length difference for destructive interference:
<p>R<sub>2 </sub>- R<sub>1</sub> = &frac12;<font face="Symbol">l</font>
.
<p>Now, we can equate these two expressions, and we find the 2t = &frac12;<font face="Symbol">l</font>
. Or, we can write that t = <font face="Symbol">l</font> /4. This is our
final result: a simple lens will reflect about 4% of the light striking
it. However, if you place a transparent coating over the lens, the reflected
light will be reduced almost of zero through destructive interference.
We will discuss the properties of light later in this chapter, but for
now, we just need to know the wavelength of the light. In the range of
light that we can see, the wavelength is roughly 0.5 <font face="Symbol">m</font>
m. So, the thickness of the "antireflection coating" needs to be about
a quarter of this, or about 0.125 <font face="Symbol">m</font> m. Of course,
this is very thin, but sophisticated techniques have been developed to
apply coatings of this thickness very precisely. It does add about $50-100
to the price of the lens, but it can be worth it. As stated above, in more
complex optical systems, like camera lenses, zoom lenses, binoculars, telescopes,
etc., antireflection coatings are absolutely essential. Here is a photograph
of two pairs of glasses. The upper one has the antireflection coating,
while the lower one does not:

<p>One major problem with these coatings is that they must be kept very
clean. If you leave a fingerprint on a lens, the thickness of the oil layer
that is left behind can easily be in the range of <font face="Symbol">m</font>
m's. Notice that if the coating thickness is t = <font face="Symbol">l</font>
/2, we will have <i>constructive</i> interference, which will make the
reflected light <i>brighter</i>. This is why the thickness must be controlled
so carefully, and why dirt on the surface can so easily disrupt the conditions
for destructive interference.
<p>Of course, creative entrepreneurs will always find a way to take advantage
of this delicate balance. Imagine that you apply a coating to a surface
that is not flat, but has been patterned in some way:
<p><img SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section5_3/408x139xImage177.gif.pagespeed.ic.OlTiyOkjge.png" height=139 width=408>
<p>The spots where the thickness produces destructive interference will appear 
  dark, while the spots where there is constructive interference will appear bright. 
  This produces interesting patterns of light and dark. In fact, it is a bit more 
  complicated since the conditions for constructive and destructive interference 
  depend on the wavelength of the light. The wavelength of light determines the 
  color that you perceive. So, different colors will show different patterns of 
  constructive and destructive interference giving a striking "rainbow" effect. 
  This effect has been used to make shiny colorful wrapping paper: <br>

<p>Another manifestation of this is the colors that you often see in puddles
in the road. Just like glass, water reflects about 4% of the light striking
it. Now, roads contain a lot of oil and some of this oil gets into the
puddle. Since oil is lighter than water it rises to the surface and spreads
out over the water, producing a thin film. This film of oil acts like the
coating that we discussed about. However, the thickness is not precisely
controlled, so it will not produce purely constructive or destructive interference.
However, it does affect how much light of each color is reflected. This
produces the patterns of very pure colors that you often see when looking
at a puddle of water.
<p><u>Sound waves in reflection</u>
<p>Interference in reflection has its most important applications when
applied to light waves. However, there are some similar situations for
sound waves. Imagine the cross-section of a standard wall. There is an
exterior wall, an interior wall and a gap in between for insulation:
<p><img SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section5_3/309x186xImage182.gif.pagespeed.ic.P--AdY0cJ7.png" height=186 width=309>
<p>When a sound wave strikes this structure, it produces two reflected
waves that can interference, just like light waves. Also, the conditions
are just the same. Let the gap in the wall be called "t". If t = <font face="Symbol">l</font>
/4 there will be destructive interference and if t = <font face="Symbol">l</font>
/2, there will be constructive interference.
<p>Another example of interference of sound comes from reflection from
steps. A common situation involves hitting a bass drum in a football field
in front of a set of bleachers:
<p><img SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section5_3/644x283xImage179.gif.pagespeed.ic.UiL_keNkyO.png" height=283 width=644>
<p>Again, if the depth of each step is given by "D", then the conditions
for destructive interference are D = <font face="Symbol">l</font> /4. There
will be constructive interference if D = <font face="Symbol">l</font> /2.
The bass drum produces many frequencies. The frequencies that produce constructive
interference will reflect strongly. So, even though the bass drum does
not produce a distinct pitch, the reflected sound does have a clear pitch
corresponding to the frequencies that interfere constructively.
