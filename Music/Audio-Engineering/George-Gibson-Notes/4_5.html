<LI><B>Vibrating bars.<BR>
</B>a) Start with a frequency of "C" = 256 Hz. Use Pythagoras technique of going up by a fifth and staying within one octave to generate 4 new notes. What are the frequencies of these notes? This is a pentatonic scale.<BR>
b) Now, assume you have a metal bar with a length of 46 cm which is tuned to the first note of the scale, "C". What should the length of a second bar be to make an interval of a perfect fifth higher? The frequency of a metal bar depends on 1/L<SUP>2</SUP> where L is the length of the bar.</LI>

where L is the length of the bar and the other quantities are not important.<BR>
a) If a bar is 0.9 m long and has a resonant frequency of 212 Hz, what is the resonant frequency of a bar that is 0.45 m long?<BR>
b) If you want to raise the resonant frequency by an octave, want length should you use?</LI>

<LI><B>Vibrating bars.<BR>
</B>A metal bar is 35 cm long and has a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz. I want to make another bar a Perfect Fourth <I>lower</I> in pitch. How long should I make the new bar? Remember, the frequency of a metal bar depends on the SQUARE of the length.</LI>

<LI><B>Vibrating bars.<BR>
</B>A metal bar is 30 cm long and has a fundamental frequency of 480 Hz.  I want to make another bar that has a frequency an octave higher in pitch.  How long should I make the new bar?  Remember, the frequency of a metal bar depends on the SQUARE of the length.</LI>

<LI><B>Vibrating bars.<BR>
</B>An interesting question came up during the demonstration of the projects: if you copy the lengths of the bars in a wind chime, but you scale it up, do the intervals stay the same? This problem will answer that question.<BR>
a) I happen to find two metal bars, identical except for their length. One is 36 cm long and has a frequency of 550 Hz. The other bar is 32.2 cm long. What is the frequency of the second bar and what is the musical interval between the two bars?<BR>
b) I now make new bars, each one 1.75 times longer than the original bars. What are the frequencies of the new bars?<BR>
c) What is the musical interval between the new bars and is it the same or different from the interval found in part a)?</LI>

<LI><B>Vibrating bars.<BR>
</B>The frequency of a vibrating bar is inversely proportional to the square of its length.<BR>
a) I have two identical bars, except that one has a length of 22 cm and the other has a length of 19 cm. What is the interval between them?<BR>
b) How long must a make another bar to be a perfect fifth above the 22 cm bar?</LI>

<LI><B>Vibrating bars.<BR></B>
a) I happen to find two metal bars, identical except for their length. One is 36 cm long the other is 44.1 cm long. What is the musical interval between them?<BR>
b) I really want an interval of an octave, but, of course, I can only shorten the bars. Which one should I shorten and how long should it be to make the two bars an octave apart?</LI>

<LI><B>Longitudinal modes of vibrating bars.<BR>
</B>A metal bar can have many different modes of vibration. One in a longitudinal wave along the bar:<BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section4_5/524x77xImage116.gif.pagespeed.ic.-zG3DA9rc2.png" WIDTH=524 HEIGHT=77><BR>
This acts like a closed-closed air column, in that there are anti-nodes at the ends of the bar. However, the velocity of sound in a metal bar, like aluminum, is 5000 m/sec. Sketch the first three modes of vibration of the bar and give the frequency, if the bar is 0.9 meters long.</LI>

<LI><B>Balaphone.<BR>
</B>a) A balaphone is an African xylophone. It has wooden bars as the oscillators. A professor in the Art Department has built several one year demonstrated for the class how he makes them. One of the most important things that he needs to know is exactly where the nodal lines of each bar are, as this is where the bar will be attached to the frame of the instrument. To do this, the builder places the bar on a soft piece of foam rubber, sprinkles some sawdust on the bar an keeps tapping on the bar. What nodal lines would he have seen?<BR>

b) Why is this the pattern observed, rather than the nodal lines for some other mode of vibration?<BR>
c) From a side view, sketch this mode of vibration.</LI>

</B>A rectangular cavity filled with air has resonant frequencies at 500 Hz, 700 Hz, and 860 Hz. If the speed of sound in carbon dioxide is 1.25 times smaller, what would these frequencies become if the cavity was filled with carbon dioxide? (Start with f<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> = v).</LI>

<LI><B>Waves in two dimensions.<BR>
</B>If we have a rectangle with dimensions L<SUB>1</SUB> and L<SUB>2</SUB> we can have sound waves traveling along either direction. The frequencies are still given by f = v/<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> were v is the velocity of sound. Remember that the wavelengths are related to the length that the wave travels along, so that we will have a series of frequencies in each direction: f<SUB>1</SUB>, f<SUB>2</SUB>, f<SUB>3</SUB>, f<SUB>4</SUB> along L<SUB>1</SUB> and g<SUB>1</SUB>, g<SUB>2</SUB>, g<SUB>3</SUB> g<SUB>4</SUB>  along L<SUB>2</SUB>.<BR>
a) Calculate the first four frequencies in each series if L<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.076 meters and L<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.15 meters.<BR>
b) In lab #4 we will measure the frequencies of a rectangle, but the frequencies we measure are not quite the same as what you just calculated. Rather, the measured frequencies, F, are related to the series above by the Pythagorian Theorem: F<SUP>2</SUP> = f<SUP>2</SUP> + g<SUP>2</SUP>. Thus, many frequencies are possible. For instance, f<SUB>2</SUB> and g<SUB>3</SUB> can combine to give:<BR>

<LI><B>Rectangular Cavity.</B><BR>
Suppose we measure the following frequencies for a rectangular cavity. Figure out the dimensions of the cavity, assuming the speed of sound is 343 m/sec. You will need to identify the two regular series. To prove that you did this correctly, show how to make up the rest of the combination frequencies. There was one problem with the apparatus, however, frequencies lower than 400 Hz could not be measured. Thus, the fundamental of one series is missing.</LI></FONT>

<LI><B>Waves in 3-D.</B><BR>
In analyzing the waves in the rectangular cavities, we must consider the fact that the waves are in two dimensional, instead of one dimensional in an air column. The question then comes up: why don't we have to worry about the third dimension?<BR>
a) Just from your memory, what is the approximate height of the cavity in the vertical direction?<BR>
b) What is the frequency of the fundamental mode in that direction?<BR>

<LI><B>Closed-closed tube<BR>
</B>So far, we have analyzed a tube or rectangular cavity and determined the resonant frequencies of the cavity. Really, what is useful is the reverse. If we measure the frequencies we can determine the dimension of the cavity. This will be true even if we cannot see the cavity directly (either it is too small or too far away).<BR>
a) What length of tube will produce the following set of frequencies: 234 Hz, 468 Hz, 702 Hz ?<BR>
b) What length of tube will produce the following set of frequencies: 986 Hz, 1479 Hz, 1972 Hz ? The difference here is that I did not record the fundamental, so you will need to figure that out. Assume in both parts that the speed of sound is 343 m/sec.</LI>
