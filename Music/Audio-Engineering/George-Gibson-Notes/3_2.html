<B><I><FONT SIZE=4><P>3.2 Pythagorean Intervals</P>
</FONT></I></B><P>As discussed in the previous section, Pythagoras was interested 
in understanding the notes and scales used in Greek music. In particular, he studied 
the Greek stringed instruments, called the lyre. His first observation was that if 
you have two strings with the same length, tension and thickness, they sound the same 
when you pluck them. This means they have the same pitch and sound good (or <U>consonant</U>) 
when played together. The second observation was that if the strings have different lengths 
(keeping the tension and thickness the same) the strings have different pitches and generally 
sound bad (or <U>dissonant</U>) when played together. Finally, he noticed that for certain 
lengths, the two strings still had different pitches, but now sounded consonant rather than 
dissonant. Pythagoras called the relationship between two notes an <U>interval</U>.</P>
<P>For example, as mentioned above, when two strings have the same length, they have the same 
pitch, and the relationship, or interval, between the notes is called a <U>unison</U>. If one 
string is exactly one-half of the length of the other string, its pitch is much higher, but they 
still sound consonant when played together. This interval is called an <U>octave</U>. Finally, 
if one string has a length that is two-thirds the length of the other, the strings again sound 
consonant when played together and this interval is called a <U>Perfect&nbsp;Fifth</U>.</P>
<P>Already, we have a very important distinction. These intervals are defined 
  by the lengths of the strings being in a certain <I>ratio</I>. One does not 
  form an octave by reducing the length of on string by a fixed amount, like 10 
  cm. Rather, one forms an octave by <I>dividing</I> the length of a string by 
  a factor of 2. In other words, if the lengths of the strings are in a ratio 
  of 2 to 1, the pitches of the strings will form an interval of an octave.</P>
<P>Musically, there are many different intervals, each with its own characteristic sound and 
each with a special role in music harmony. We will encounter quite a few intervals during the 
course. Each interval will have a name, like an octave, and it will be defined by a ratio, like 
2:1 for the octave.</P>
<P>So far, our list of intervals includes:</P>

<P>As mentioned above, each interval has a particular characteristic. The unison may not seem 
so interesting, as the two notes are the same. This may be true, but it is the simplest and most 
fundamental interval. However, it can be used to great effect. Imagine a singer singing a simple 
melody. Now imagine a chorus of a hundred voices, all singing the same melody in <I>unison</I>, 
i.e. everyone singing exactly the same pitch. It is actually very hard to have that many people 
sing perfectly enough, but when they do the effect is quite dramatic. So, great composers can use 
even the simplest interval effectively.</P>
<P>The octave is the next most important interval. As discussed in the previous section, it defines 
the range of the music scale. Two notes an octave apart sound so similar that they are always given 
the same name. For example, elementary piano pieces often start on middle C. However, if you go up an 
octave from there, the note is still called a C. In fact, it is sometime hard to tell whether two 
notes are one or two octaves apart. If someone has a deep voice and cannot sing a particular melody 
because the notes are too high, it is always acceptable to sing the melody an octave lower. Musically, 
the melody is the same.</P>
<P>Finally, we come to the Perfect Fifth. In this case, there is no question that two notes a Perfect 
Fifth apart are really two different notes. On the piano, the note a Perfect Fifth above Middle C is 
called a G. Thus, the Perfect Fifth is the first interval to get us into <I>harmony</I>, the question 
of how different pitches interact with each other. Once again, the Perfect Fifth has a special quality 
to it – anyone who has heard Gregorian chant will recognize the open haunting quality of the Perfect Fifth.</P>
<P>So far, we have only talked about intervals in terms of going <I>up</I> in pitch. However, we can go 
down, as well. If you start with a string and you double its length, the pitch will go <I>down</I> by an octave.</P>

<P>It is also very important to notice that intervals do not depend on the initial frequency, 
length, tension or type of string. Intervals only give a relationship between two notes, but 
so far, like Pythagoras, we only defined them in terms of lengths of strings. It turns out that 
for a string, if you divide the length of the string by a factor of two, the frequency goes up 
by a factor of two. So, whether we are considering the lengths of the strings or their pitches, 
the ratios for the intervals are the same.</P>
<P>Musically, intervals are very important, but why are we discussing them so 
  carefully in a physics course? From a scientific standpoint, by far the most 
  important characteristic of these simple consonant intervals is that they are 
  defined by ratios of small integers. This was very exciting to Pythagoras. Consider 
  the fact that Pythagoras had just invented mathematics and integers, in particular. 
  And, he had just invented arithmetic. But, this was just abstract thought. Pythagoras 
  had no way of knowing whether mathematics would actually be useful for anything. 
  It then turns out that integers and ratios could describe the consonant musical 
  intervals.</P>
<P>Actually, this also highlights a deep connection between the human experience and abstract 
mathematics. What appears to be a subjective judgment, this interval sounds good (consonant), 
that interval sounds bad (dissonant) can actually be predicted using abstract mathematics. 
Apparently, our emotional response to the world sometimes even follows mathematical laws!</P>
<P>Returning now to intervals, we can define a new operation, namely, combining intervals. For 
example, we could go up in pitch by an interval of an octave and down by an interval of a Perfect 
Fifth. In this case, going up by an octave means multiplying the frequency by a factor of 2. Going 
down by a Fifth means dividing by 3/2. All together we have 2/(3/2) = 4/3. Thus, by combining 
intervals, we have actually produced a new interval, called the Perfect Fourth. The Perfect Fourth 
is defined by a ratio of 4/3.</P>
<P>To summarize:</P>
<P>Ratios of 1/2 and 2/1 give octaves</P>
<P>Ratios of 2/3, 3/2 give fifths</P>
<P>Ratios of 3/4, 4/3 give fourths</P>
<P>Notice that the ratios above only involve the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. As an exercise it is 
helpful to write out ALL ratios involving these integers:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Now, try to determine what interval each of these corresponds to. For example, 2/3 corresponds 
to going down by a Perfect Fifth. 4/1 corresponds to going up by an octave TWICE. In other words, 
since going up an octave means multiplying by 2, going up two octaves means multiplying by 2 twice, 
or 2x2 = 4.</P>
<P>At this point, we can ask, why stop at 4? Why not use 5, 6, 7, and 8 as ratios for intervals. 
The answer is that we can use larger integers. However, Pythagoras stopped 4 because he realized 
that he had all the intervals that he needed to construct the musical scale, and that was his 
original goal. Moreover, Pythagoras was a great believer in simplicity – he wanted the simplest 
explanation for the musical as possible. He believed that simplest explanation must be the correct 
one. To this day, this continues to be a central conviction in physics and science.</P>
<P>In fact, Pythagoras was so happy with these intervals that he called them "Perfect", i.e. the 
Perfect Fifth and the Perfect Fourth. (The unison and octave are also perfect, but as discussed 
above, they are so perfect they are not really considered to be a new note.)</P>
<P>In a later section, we will discuss how to create a musical scale from these intervals, but 
first we will organize what we have learned in a slightly different way, which will make 
constructing the scale a bit easier.</P>

<P>Although we don’t yet have enough notes for a complete musical scale, these were, in fact, the 
notes to which the strings on the Greek lyre were tuned. Also, Gregorian chant was mostly based on 
fourths and fifths and, so, used these notes primarily.</P>
<P>Of course, we can start on any note we want, D = 293 Hz is just an example.</P></BODY>
