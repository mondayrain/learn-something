<B><I><FONT SIZE=4><P>7.3 Pure Tones, Consonance and Dissonance</P>
</FONT></I></B><P>We briefly discussed the perception of consonance and dissonance of pure tones in Section 5.5. We stated that beat frequencies in the range of 10 – 50 Hz are annoying to the ear. We can now explain this in a bit more detail based on the structure of the ear that we developed in the last two sections.</P>
<U><P>Two pure tones played together:</P>
</U><P><U>Loudness.</U> The first consequence of the Critical Bandwidth is on how the loudness of two tones is perceived. If two tones are within the critical bandwidth, the combination does not sound as loud as if they are separated by more than the CB:</P>

<P>If the two tones are quite separate in frequency, as much of the Basilar Membrane 
  is activated as possible. However, if the CB of the tones overlap, a smaller 
  part of the membrane is activated, and the two tones do not sound as loud. If 
  the neurons are already firing in response to one tone, it does not help to 
  have the other tone also trying to make them fire.</P>
<P><U>Roughness.</U> If tones are overlapping, there is a region on the Basilar Membrane where the neurons are trying to respond to both tones. The problem is that the neurons don’t know which frequency to follow. The neurons end up jumping back and forth between the two frequencies. This gives rises to a rough or unpleasant sensation. It also makes it hard to focus ones attention on just one of the two tones.</P>

</U><P>We are now in a position to analyze what two pure tones will sound like based on the difference of the two frequencies. If:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Notice how the frequencies of the notes will affect the perception. The first 
  distinctions, 10 Hz, 15, Hz and 30-40 Hz are absolute frequencies, and are independent 
  of the frequencies of the individual notes. The last to conditions (&gt; half 
  step and &gt; C.B.) are defined relative to the frequencies of the two notes. 
  Thus, these conditions will apply differently for different ranges of frequencies.</P>
<P>For example, consider a Perfect Fifth between C = 64 Hz and G = 96 Hz. Usually, 
  the Perfect Fifth is considered to be a consonant interval, even with complex 
  tones. However, the difference between these two frequencies is 32&nbsp;Hz. 
  This is in the range of dissonance. Thus, normally consonant intervals, when 
  played at very low frequencies will sound dissonant. For this reason, composers 
  rarely use a simple Perfect Fifth in the low range of a piano. Rather, they 
  will use the interval of an Octave and a Perfect Fifth. Now, the notes would 
  be C = 64 Hz, and G = 192 Hz. The difference frequency is 128 Hz, well within 
  the range of consonance.</P>
<P><U>Difference tones</U>:</P>
<P>Once the difference tone exceeds the lowest frequency that you can easily hear, the brain starts to interpret the beat frequency as a new note. For example, if one plays an A = 220&nbsp;Hz and an E = 330 Hz, the difference tone is at 110 Hz, and it will sound like another note is being played an Octave below the A.</P></BODY>
