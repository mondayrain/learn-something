<B><I><FONT SIZE=4><P>3.1 Neanderthal flutes and Greek lyres</P>
</FONT></I></B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The origins of music and science go far back in time, perhaps even earlier 
than modern human beings. Perhaps more importantly, the connection between music and science appears to be 
equally as ancient. We will explore this history with two instruments. The Greek lyre is a stringed instrument 
that was thoroughly studied by the Greek mathematician, Pythagoras in about 600 BC. The second instrument was 
only recently discovered and dates back to the time of the Neanderthals and appears to be a flute made out of 
an animal bone.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both the flute and the lyre are fairly sophisticated instruments upon which a melody can be 
played. Thus, they are called melodic instruments. The other main group of instruments is called percussion. 
This group includes drums, cymbals, and triangles, for example. They can be used for great dramatic effect in a 
piece of music but cannot really sustain a melody. Now, off hand, one might think that percussion instruments are 
easier to make than melodic instruments and would have been developed first. This may be the case, but, 
interestingly, the physics of melodic instruments is actually simpler than that of percussion instruments. In 
light of this, it is not surprisingly that the <I>science</I> of musical instruments started with melodic instruments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this same reason, we will also begin our study of music and instruments with melodic 
instruments and only later delve into the more complex physics of the percussion instruments.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Neanderthal flute</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not too long ago, a remarkable discovery was made: an animal 
  bone was found at a Neanderthal camp site. The significant feature of the bone 
  is that it has fairly small very circular holes drilled into it. It obviously 
  took some time and skill to create these holes, which immediately raises the 
  question: why did the Neanderthals spend the effort to make them? The pattern 
  of the holes is also striking: they are in a line but they are not equally spaced. 
  This bone can be seen at: <A HREF="http://www.greenwych.ca/fl-compl.htm">www.greenwych.ca/fl-compl.htm</A>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the conclusions are controversial, it appears that the bone is, in fact, a musical 
instrument as the arrangement of the holes is the same as that of a modern flute. If correct, this is a profound 
insight because of the many implications. It implies that:</P>
<ul>

<li>Music has been around a very long time and predates modern humans.</li>
<li>The Neanderthals created and appreciated music.</li>
<li>They were capable of skilled craftsmanship.</li>
<li>They used their technical skills to make musical instruments.</li>
<li>They had some level of reasoning to choose a particular hole spacing.</li>
<li>They used the same harmony and musical scale as we use today!</li>
</ul>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This last point is as subtle as it is significant and we will need to learn a bit more 
about musical scales and instruments before we can fully appreciate it. However, it does hint at the conclusion 
that Western music and harmony is not a purely cultural creation but has its roots in some basic physics that 
applied to the Neanderthals just as much as it applies to us. It also encourages us to examine more closely the 
connection between physics and music.</P>
<U><P>Pythagoras and Greek lyres</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually, the idea that it might be interesting to apply scientific 
  analysis to music and musical instruments it not particularly new. In fact, 
  it was thought of at least back to the time of Pythagoras. Pythagoras was, as 
  far as we know, the first person to seriously study mathematics, science and 
  music. Most everyone as been exposed to the Pythagorean Theorem sometime in 
  High School. This is just one of the many results and accomplishments of Pythagoras.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The popular instrument of the day in Pythagoras’s time was 
  the lyre. It consisted of frame on which were strung four strings and each string 
  was adjusted to produce a certain pitch when plucked. Pythagoras was intrigued 
  by this instrument and wanted to understand exactly why the strings were set 
  at particular pitches and why these pitches followed a particular scale. However, 
  before we continue, we must introduce a bit of music theory – about the only 
  music theory that we will need for the rest of the course!</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Musical Scales</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we start to examine music and music theory one of the most significant observations 
is that not all pitches are used. Consider a violin: you can move your figure along the string to produce a 
continuous range of pitches. However, in any musical composition, you only play from a certain group of pitches 
called notes. Depending on the type of music, Western, Arabic, Asian, India, etc. there may be many or few 
notes that are used, but the point is that there is a definite collection of pitches that are played. For special 
effects, musicians may slide from one note to another covering a continuous range of pitch, but this is not really 
part of the melody or harmony. This set of notes is organized into what is called a musical <U>scale</U>. Again, the 
particular notes that comprise a scale vary from culture to culture, but organizing the notes into a scale is universal.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All scales share another feature: they are specified only over 
  a small range of notes called an <U>octave</U>. Most everyone is familiar with 
  the names of the notes on the piano: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. These are the "white" 
  notes on the piano, and anyone who has taken piano lessons probably started 
  out by playing this sequence. However, there are many more than eight white 
  keys on the piano, so what are the names of the rest of the notes? If you every 
  look at a piano keyboard you would notice that the pattern of white keys and 
  black keys repeats up and down the piano. In the same way, the names of the 
  notes repeat up and down the keyboard. With this in mind, the sequence of notes 
  above form a scale, called the C major scale. Once you reach the end of the 
  scale, it simply repeats as you go higher or lower. Furthermore, the range from 
  one C to the next is called an octave. We will discuss all of this in much more 
  detail in the next few sections, but it is helpful to get some sense of what 
  is coming up.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to Pythagoras, as mentioned above, he was intrigued 
  by the fact that scales exist and he wanted to know why Greek music was based 
  on a particular kind of scale, in other words, why did Greek musicians use a 
  particular sequence of notes for their musical scale. These questions that Pythagoras 
  asked launched a way of thinking and analyzing the world that has produced a 
  tremendous body of knowledge that Pythagoras could never have dreamed of. Indeed, 
  Pythagoras’s method of understanding the musical scale eerily foreshadowed the 
  sequence of steps that led to the development of Quantum Mechanics and modern 
  physics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For historical correctness, I need to point out that what we know
about Pythagoras is rather indirect, mostly coming from what other people wrote about
Pythagoras.  It is known that he did study intervals and scales and came up with
the "Pythagorean" intervals.</P>
