<B><LI>Metal bars.</B><BR>
Let's say that you have a metal bar that is 19.5 cm long and vibrates at A = 440 Hz.<BR>
a)  How much would you have to cut off the bar to raise the pitch by a Just whole step (9/8)?<BR>
b)  Before I cut off the full amount found in a), I first cut off just 0.75 mm (= 0.075 cm).  What is the new frequency and could I hear the change in pitch?</LI>

<B><LI>Intervals.</B><BR>
If you keep going up by perfect fifths, you never reach a perfect octave. This is the basic problem with all methods of tuning. We will look at the minor third, in the same way.<BR>
a) The Pythagorean minor third corresponds to 32/27. How many Pythagorean minor thirds are in an octave? Can you tell the difference between the octave formed by this interval and a perfect octave?<BR>
b) Repeat a) for a Just minor third, 6/5.<BR>
c) Repeat a) for an Equal Temper minor third, 3 half-steps.</LI>

<B><LI>Smallest possible interval in a scale.<BR>
</B>a) Using the Pythagorean system for generating notes on a scale, one could add notes endlessly. However, at some point you would no longer to hear the difference between the notes. How many notes could you just distinguish in a half-step? (Or, how many just-noticeable-differences make up a half step?)<BR>
b) What would be the total number of notes in one octave in this system?</LI>

<B><LI>Just-noticeable-difference for the major third.<BR>
</B>a) Start with a pitch of A = 440 Hz. In the Pythagorean scale, a major third is two whole steps. What is the frequency of a Pythagorean major third above A = 440 Hz?<BR>
b) In an equal temper scale what is the frequency of a major third above A = 440 Hz?<BR>
c) In the Just scale what is the frequency of a major third above A = 440 Hz?<BR>
d) Can you hear the difference between these pitches?</LI>

<B><LI>Just-noticeable-difference for the perfect fifth.</B><BR>
Repeat the previous problem for an interval of a perfect fifth.</LI>

<B><LI>Doppler shift.</B><BR>
a) You are running down a football field at 5 meter/second towards a band playing a note at 500 Hz. What note would you hear?<BR>
b) At 500 Hz, what would be the smallest change in frequency that would be necessary for you to hear a difference? (I.e. the just-noticeable-difference). Could you hear the change in frequency found in part a)?</LI>

<B><LI>Doppler shift in speakers.</B><BR>
I read about an effect in speakers which seems peculiar: the claim was that if a speaker is sounding loudly at 100 Hz, it is moving back and forth with a high velocity. At the same time, if the speaker is also sounding a note at 1000 Hz, the higher sound can be Doppler shifted by the motion at the lower frequency, distorting the pitch. We want to estimate this effect.<BR>
a) Assume the speaker is vibrating at 100 Hz with an amplitude of 1 cm. This is a very large amplitude. What would be the maximum speed of the surface of the speaker?<BR>
b) Now consider a tone at 1000 Hz. What would be the Doppler shifted frequency of this note using the speed from a) and the moving source Doppler shift?<BR>
c) You can detect a frequency change of at most 1/200 of the original frequency. Could you hear the frequency shift from the Doppler effect?</LI>

<B><LI>Can you run fast enough to hear a Doppler shift?</B><BR>
a) A very good sprinter can run at 10 m/sec. If you run at this speed away from an alarm sounding a frequency of 1200 Hz, what pitch would you hear?<BR>
b) Can you detect this change in pitch? What is the Just-Noticeable-Difference?<BR>
c) Would the shift in frequency be greater than a half-step?</LI>

<LI><B>Doppler shift/sailboats.<BR>
</B>You are in a sailboat sailing down wind. Because the boat is traveling with the wind you feel no breeze even though the wind is blowing at 20 miles/hour with respect to the ground. You are moving directly away from the shore where your friend is playing a note on a tuba at 120 Hz. (Note: this problem is about sound waves, not water waves!)<BR>
a) With respect to the medium, who is the source, who is the observer and who is moving?<BR>
b) What frequency of sound does the observer hear?<BR>
c) Could you hear the change in pitch due to the Doppler shift?</LI>

<B><LI>Critical bandwidth<BR>
</B>The Critical Bandwidth of the ear is about 19% of the frequency of the tone heard.<BR>
a) If you start with a frequency of 256 Hz, how much must a second tone be so that the critical bandwidths of the two tones do not overlap?<BR>
b) What is the nearest interval to these two tones?</LI>

<B><LI>"Consonant" scale.</B><BR>
a) Suppose you wanted to construct a scale where no two notes ever had overlapping critical bands so that you could play any two notes without producing dissonant intervals. How many notes would be in the scale?<BR>
b) The scale in the previous question works for a xylophone but not for a regular instrument like a violin. Why would a any two notes of the "consonant" scale sound consonant with a xylophone but not a violin?</LI>

<B><LI>Hearing perception.<BR>
</B>The critical bandwidth of the ear is 0.190 times the frequency, except that it is never less than 90 Hz.<B><BR>
</B>a) Start at A = 440 Hz. What would your ear hear if you play this and the note one half-step higher?<BR>
b) What would your ear hear if you play this A and the note two half-steps higher?<B><BR>
</B>c) What would your ear hear if you play this A and the note four half-steps higher?<B><BR>
</B>d) Now start at A = 110 Hz. What would your ear hear if you play this and the note one half-step higher?<BR>
e) What would your ear hear if you play this lower A and the note two half-steps higher?<B><BR>
</B>f) What would your ear hear if you play this lower A and the note four half-steps higher?</LI>

<B><LI>2-D Cavity as a musical instrument.<BR>
</B>Heres what would happen if we made a musical instrument out of a 2-D air cavity instead of the normal 1-D cavity.<BR>

<B><LI>Siren.</B><BR>
A police car with a siren at 800 Hz is coming at you at 25 miles/hour.  However, the sound from the siren also reflects off of a building behind the car and reaches you.  You are not moving.<BR>

a) At what harmonic do adjacent harmonics lie within a critical bandwidth?<BR>
b) At what harmonic do adjacent harmonics lie within a Just-Noticeable-Difference? Can you hear that high a pitch.</LI>

<B><LI>Tuning pianos/beats.</B><BR>
This problem comes from a discussion I had with my piano tuner as he tunes my piano and describes a method for precisely tuning octaves.<BR>
a) Start with A = 220 Hz. What is the frequency of the note (F) a major third lower, according to the Just scale?<BR>
b) What is the frequency of the first common overtone of these two notes?<BR>
c) What is the frequency of the note a major third (four half-steps) lower than A = 220 Hz, according to the Equal Temper scale?<BR>
d) What is the beat frequency of between the common overtones found in part b)? (By common overtone I mean those that are with 10 Hz of each other.)<BR>
e) Finally, what is the first common overtone between the note found in part c) and A = 440 Hz and what is the beat frequency?<BR>
<BR>
By comparing the results from d) and e) you can determine if the A = 220 Hz and the A = 440 Hz form a perfect octave.<BR><BR></LI>

<B><LI>Using beats for precise tuning.<BR>
</B>The differences between the Equal Temper and Pythagorean scale are just on the threshold of human perception. So, they would be hard to tune precisely. However, using beats, these intervals can be tuned precisely, as you will see in this problem.<BR>
a) Start at F = 171 Hz. Find the frequency for the note "A", which is a major third higher, in each tunings:<BR>
Pythagorean = <BR>
Equal Temper = <BR>
b) What is the Just Noticeable Difference at this frequency? Can you hear the difference between these?<BR>
c) The fifth harmonic of the F and the fourth harmonic of the A are very close. What are the beat frequencies between these harmonics in the two different scales? By listening for this beat frequency you can tune to one scale or the other.</LI>

a) What are the overtones of a bar with a fundamental frequency of 220 Hz?<BR>
b) What is the fundamental frequency and overtones of a bar tuned on octave higher?<BR>
c) Will these bars sound consonant or dissonant when struck at the same time?</LI>

<B><LI>Overtone series<BR>
</B>A peculiar instrument has an overtone series given by: <IMG SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section7_6/40x33xImage267.gif.pagespeed.ic.YXe3lj_AyS.png" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=33>f, where f is the fundamental and <I>n</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 1, 2, 3 (Note: 2<SUP>0</SUP> = 1).<BR>
a) If the fundamental frequency of a note is 525 Hz, what are the next 3 overtones?<BR>
b) Now find the pitch and overtones of a note a Perfect Fifth higher.<BR>
c) If I play these two notes together, how will they sound? Justify your answer: what are the beat frequencies and how would they sound to you.</LI>

<LI><B>Pan Flutes.<BR>
</B>One class project was a pan flute made out of open-open tubes and it was claimed that the end correction is not important.  Assume two tubes are cut so that they make an interval of an octave.  The longer tube has a length of 38.98 cm and the shorter one has a length of 19.49 cm.  The radius of the tubes is 1 cm.<BR>
a)  Ignoring the end correction, what are the fundamental frequencies of the two tubes?<BR>
b)  How would these notes sound (consonant, dissonant, beats, etc.) if they were played together? (Remember, the tubes will produce complex tones.)<BR>
c)  What are the actual frequencies of the two tubes, if you take into account the end correction?  (Remember, it is an open-open tube).<BR>
d)  How would the actual notes found in part c) sound if they were played together? Is the end correction important?</LI>

<LI><B>Eight Note Scale.<BR>
</B>One project based a xylophone on a scale made up of 8 equal "half steps".  The ratio for this "half step" is then 1.0905.<BR>
a)  Consider an interval made up of three of these "half-steps".  What is the ratio for this interval?  What would be the Just version of this interval?  (I.e. what ratio of integers less than 10 comes closest to this value?)<BR>
b)  Fill in the following table.  On the second line, enter the harmonics of 220 Hz.  On the third line, enter the fundamental of a note three "half-steps" higher in this scale, and its harmonics.  Don't go past 1500 Hz.<BR>

<B><LI>Missing fundamental<BR>
</B>When you play the second harmonic on a violin the pitch seems to go up by an octave. The concept of the missing fundamental would seem to say that you should still hear the fundamental as the pitch of the note. Why does the pitch go up and why does not the missing fundamental apply here? What would be the difference for open-closed instruments?</LI>

<B><LI>Consonance and dissonance between different instruments.<BR>
</B>It is possible that intervals sound more or less consonant depending on which instruments are playing the notes in the interval. Consider an equal temper major third.<BR>
a) Find all of the conflicting harmonics if violins play each of the two notes.<BR>
b) Now assume that a clarinet plays the lower note and a violin plays the upper note. How does this situation compare to part a)?<BR>
c) Now the clarinet plays the upper note and the violin plays the lower note. Is this more or less consonant than the interval in part b)?<BR>
d) Finally, assume clarinets play both notes. Are there any conflicting harmonics?</LI>

<B><LI>Complex tones: violins and clarinets.</B><BR>
A violin has a full harmonic series, while a clarinet has a partial harmonics series (1f, 3f, 5f, ).<BR>
a) For a violin, fill in the following table for the first 6 harmonics of E = 660 Hz and the harmonics of the note a Perfect Fifth higher.  Which harmonics do these notes have in common?<BR>
b) If the second note were played 10 Hz too low, fill in the last line in the table.  Would the interval sound consonant or dissonant?<BR>
c) If a clarinet played the note is part b) while a violin still played the first note, would it sound consonant or dissonant?</LI>

<B><LI>Difference tones<BR>
</B>If you play a note and a major third above it, what is the difference tone and what interval is it below the original note?</LI>

<B><LI>Difference tones in a major triad</B><BR>
A major triad consists of a primary note (called the tonic), a second note a Just Major third higer and a third note a Perfect Fifth above the primary. Show that all of the difference tones between the fundamentals of each note occur at one or more octaves below the tonic. In other words, all of the difference tones in a major triad reinforce the tonic note.</LI>
