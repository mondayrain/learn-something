<LI><B>Double Doppler shift.</B><BR>
Many times, the Doppler shift is used under conditions where a wave is reflected off of a target (like a police radar detector used to catch speeders or bats looking for an insect). However, calculating the Doppler shift becomes a little more complicated.<BR>
a) A bat is flying towards a wall at 10 m/sec and emits a pitch of 10,000 Hz. What frequency would a bug on the hear (if it could hear)? Here, the bat is a moving source and the wall is stationary.<BR>
b) The reflected sound will have the same frequency as that heard by the bug, in other words, the Doppler shifted frequency. What frequency would the reflected wave appear to have for the bat? Now, the bat is a moving observer.<BR>
c) The bat actually listens for the beat frequency between the sound it emits and the reflected sound. What would be the beat frequency in this case?</LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2><B>Sodium spectrum.<BR>
</B>Many streetlights contain sodium atoms, which strongly give off yellow light at two wavelengths: 589.00&nbsp;nm and 589.59&nbsp;nm. 1 nm = 10<SUP>-9</SUP> m.<BR>
a) What frequencies do these wavelengths correspond to and what is the beat frequency between them?<BR>
b) If a spaceship is approaching the Earth at 5x10<SUP>6</SUP> m/sec, what frequencies would the pilot measure from the streetlights, and what would be the new beat frequency</LI>

</FONT><LI><FONT SIZE=2><B>Doppler shift of light.</B><BR>
The Doppler shift of light is an extremely important tool for astronomers, as they can use it to measure how fast distance objects are moving. Atoms, like hydrogen, emit light at specific wavelengths. Since the Doppler effect changes the frequency of the wave it also changes the wavelength.<BR>
a) Hydrogen emits a particularly strong line at 121.5 nm. What frequency does this correspond to?<BR>
b) If a star is moving away from us at 3x10<SUP>6</SUP> m/sec, what frequency would we measure?<BR>
c) What is the change in wavelength</LI>

<LI><B>Radar guns.</B><BR>
In order to get a large Doppler shift, the source or observe must be traveling at a reasonable fraction of the velocity of the wave. However, police officers can use the Doppler shift of microwaves to accurately measure the velocity of a car, which is MUCH less than the speed of light. The precision comes from measuring beats. Police radar uses a frequency of 10<SUP>9</SUP> Hz.<BR>
a) If the police officer is standing by the side of the road, what is the frequency of the radar that you would detect in your car after you pass by at 60 miles/hr = 27 m/sec)?<BR>
b) The microwaves reflected by the car now act as a moving source as they travel back to the police officer. What is the frequency of the reflected microwaves that the police officer would detect?<BR>
c) What is the beat frequency between the original radiation and the reflected radiation? This beat frequency can be very accurately measured.</LI>

<LI><B>Motorboats.</B><BR>
a) A trumpet player standing on the side of a lake sounds an A with a frequency of 440 Hz.  You are in a motor moving away from the shore at a speed of 13 m/sec.  With respect to the medium, which is moving, the source or the observer and what frequency do you hear?  The air is calm.<BR>
b) Now the wind is blowing in the same direction and with the same speed as the motorboat. Again, with respect to the medium, which is moving, the source or the observer and what frequency do you hear?<BR>
c) At this point the wind reverses direction, but still has a speed of 13 m/sec.  Now what frequency do you hear?</LI>

<LI><B>Doppler shift<BR>
 </B>a) A trumpet player standing on the side of a lake sounds a middle C with a frequency of 256 Hz. You are in a motor boat moving away from the shore at a speed of 8 m/sec. What frequency do you hear? The air is calm. Which is moving, the source or the observer?<BR>
b) Now the wind is blowing in the same direction and with the same speed as the motor boat. What frequency do you hear? Which is moving, the source or the observer?<BR>
c) At this point the wind reverses direction. Now what frequency do you hear?</LI>

<LI><B>Tuning an orchestra in the wind.</B><BR>
An orchestra is playing outside and the wind is blowing. We want to see how this effects the tuning of the instruments. If the oboe player plays an "A" at 440 Hz and the wind is blowing at 20 miles/hour what frequency will be heard by the players upwind from the oboe? What frequency will be heard downwind?</LI>

You are sailing between to banks of a lake. The wind is blowing at 12 m/sec from left to right and the boat is moving in the same direction at exactly the same speed. A siren is sounding on each bank at the same frequency of 1750 Hz.<BR>
a) On the boat, what frequencies do you hear from the left and right siren?<BR>
b) What is the beat frequency between these two Doppler shifted frequencies?</LI>

<LI><B>Relativistic Doppler shift.<BR>
</B>a) A space ship is approaching the earth at 90% of the speed of light, announcing its arrive at a radio frequency of 91.7 MHz. Using the normal formula for Doppler shifts, what frequency would we receive the message at?<BR>
b) Now use the relativistic formula. What frequency would we receive?<BR>
