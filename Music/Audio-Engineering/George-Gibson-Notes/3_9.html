a) On the figure, indicate with an (x) where you would press your finger the fundamental string to bring its pitch up a fifth to create a unison between the strings. This technique requires you to place you finger precisely in the correct location.<BR>
b) Alternatively, you can place a finger lightly on each string to produce a harmonic. Indicate with a dot where you would place your finger on each string to produce a common harmonic.<BR>
c) Why is this technique more accurate than the first?</LI>

<LI><B>Notes and harmonics on string instruments.<BR>
</B>Consider a string on a cello or violin. If you press firmly on the string, you effectively change the length of the string without changing the tension.<BR>

a) Mark on the string with an X the position where you should press to raise the pitch of the string by a Perfect Fourth.<BR>
b) Now, if you lightly touch the string, you don't change the length, but you create a node in the vibrational mode at that point. Sketch the mode if you lightly touch the string at the same position as in part a).<BR>

b) An open-closed tube.<BR>
c) What is the interval between these two frequencies?</LI>

<LI><B>Finger holes and nodes<BR>
</B>A finger hole in a woodwind instrument creates a node in the mode of vibration at that point. This is just like gently touching a string when plucked to produce an overtone. A finger hole is 10 cm from one end of a 30 cm tube. In which kind(s) of tube will this produce an overtone: closed-closed, open-closed, open-open. This means that you can find a proper mode with a node at the specified point. Sketch the case(s) that work.</LI>

<LI><B>Nodes of an air column.</B><BR>
Which overtones of a closed-closed air column have nodes in the middle of the tube?<BR>
Which overtones of an open-open air column have nodes in the middle of the tube?</LI>

<LI><B>Flutes and clarinets<BR>
</B>With real instruments, it is sometimes hard to tell if the instrument acts like an open-open or an open-closed air column. A flute, for example, clearly has one open end, while the other end is closed. However, the blow hole may act like an open end. So, we would like another way to figure this out.<BR>
a) The lowest note on a flute is a "C" at 262 Hz. The length of the flute is about 24 inches. From this information, determine whether the flute acts like an open-open or open-closed air column. Does your answer predict the correct overtone series for a flute?<BR>
b) The length of a clarinet is also about 24 inches, but the lowest note on a clarinet is 147 Hz. Does the clarinet act like an open-open or open-closed air column and why? Does this agree with the overtone series?</LI>

<LI><B>Overtones of an air column.</B><BR>
Suppose you measure the following overtones of an air column: 375 Hz, 675 Hz, 875 Hz, 1175 Hz. However, you also realize that you probably did not record the fundamental frequency. Is the air column open-closed, open-open, or is the series wrong? (I.e. does not correspond to either case.) Give your reasoning. If it is a proper series, what is the fundamental frequency?</LI>

<LI><B>Series of frequencies.</B><BR>
The following series is missing one or more of the lowest frequencies: 2500, 3500, 4500, 5500 Hz ?<BR>
a) This series can be part of the overtone series for an air column with which of the following boundary conditions (there may be more than one): closed-closed ends, closed-open ends, open-open ends?<BR>
b) What are the missing low frequencies?</LI>

<LI><B>Series of frequencies.</B><BR>

<LI><B>Series of frequencies.</B><BR>
State whether the following series correspond to an open-open tube, an open-closed tube or neither. One or more of the low frequencies may be missing. If a series does correspond to an open-open or an open-closed tube, give the fundamental frequency of the tube.</LI></FONT>

<LI><B>End corrections for an air column.<BR>
</B>You have a tube that is 0.63 meters long. A resonance of the tube was measured for each of three different cases: both ends closed, one end open and one end closed, both ends open. Also, the frequency is affected by the end correction. For each frequency, state whether the tube is open-open, open-closed or closed-closed and what mode it is in. You don?t have to calculate the end correction, itself.<BR>
a) 402.0 Hz<BR>
b) 1088.9 Hz<BR>
c) 527.7 Hz</LI>

<LI><B>End corrections for an air column.<BR>
</B>You start with a closed-closed tube with a fundamental frequency of 571.7 Hz.  Assume that the speed of sound is 343 m/sec.<BR>
a) How long is the tube?<BR>
b) Now, you unblock the ends, so that you have an open-open tube with the same length as before.  What should the radius of the tube be so that the open-open tube has a frequency one half step lower than the closed-closed tube?  (Use 16/15 for the half step).</LI>

<LI><B>Pan flutes.</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section3_9/xI3-9001.JPG.pagespeed.ic.QTmPEkxx_B.jpg"><BR>
One of the projects demonstrated in a previous class was a pan flute and several interesting comments were made about it.  Each note was made out of a open-closed tube.  The radius of the tubes was approximately 1 cm.<BR>
a)  First, consider just a regular open-closed tube with no end correction.  How long should we make the tube so that it plays an A = 440 Hz?<BR>
b)  Now, it was stated that inserting the stopper raised the pitch by about a whole step.  How far into the tube must the stopper be pushed to raise the pitch by exactly a Just whole step (9/8)?  Is you answer reasonable?<BR>
c)  Then, it was stated that the end correction was not significant enough to worry about.  Assume that we have an open closed tube that plays an A = 440 Hz if we don't consider the end correction, as in part a).  Now, find out what the pitch would be if we did consider the end correction.  Can you hear the difference between these two pitches?</LI>

a) One question that arose was whether the whistle acts as a closed-closed or open-closed air column. There is an opening, but it is off to the side, so the answer is not obvious. However, I measured the pitch of the whistle to be 816.7 Hz. What would the fundamental frequency of the whistle be for each of the two cases?<BR>
a) What is the whistle, closed-closed or open-closed? Is there an end correction?<BR>
b) Normally, the end correction means that the tube seems longer by an amount 0.6(radius of tube). If the whistle was open-closed, what would the fundamental frequency be with and without the end correction?</LI>

<LI><B>End corrections for an air column.<BR>
</B>When you measure the resonances of an air column, you find the following series of frequencies:
310, 620, 930, 1240, ... Hz.  The tube has a radius of 2 cm.<BR>
a) Is the tube open-open or open-closed?<BR>
b) Find the actual  length of the tube, taking into account the end correction.  Remember that an open-open tube has an end correction at each end.</LI>

c)  The Just minor sixth is the ratio of two numbers, each less than 10, that is the closest to the answer in part a).  What is the Just minor sixth?</LI>

<LI><B>Brass instruments.</B><BR>
The overtone series of a brass instrument is a harmonic series. If the fundamental frequency is f, the overtone series is 1f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, 6f, 7f, 8f?. What combination of intervals from the fundamental does each of these tones correspond to? For example, 4f is two octaves above the fundamental.</LI>

<LI><B>Natural trumpet.</B><BR>
We considered the intervals formed by the first seven overtones of a brass instrument, 1f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, 6f, 7f. Now consider the next few: 8f, 9f, 10f, 11f, 12f. What interval does each overtone form with respect to the 8f overtone? If the interval is not exactly one of the intervals you know, which one is it closest to?</LI>

<LI><B>New intervals.<BR>
</B>There are several intervals that we have not considered, yet. For each interval, find the ratio corresponding to that interval in the equal temper scale. Then find the ratio of integers, which is close to this value - this will determine the interval in the Just scale:<BR>
Minor third = 3 half steps<BR>
Minor sixth = 8 half steps<BR>
Major sixth = 9 half steps<BR>
Seventh = 11 half steps</LI>

<LI><B>Pairs of intervals.<BR>
</B>Show that certain pairs of intervals combine to give an octave. How many pairs can you find? Some pairs may not come out perfectly in the Just scale or the Pythagorean scale. Give the pairs that come close and state whether they give a perfect Octave or not in each of the scales. Why will the pairs always come out perfectly in the Equal Temper scale?</LI>

<LI><B>Triads<BR>
</B>Triads consist of three notes. They contain three different intervals: the first to second note, the first to third and the second to third.<BR>
a) The major triad has notes in the ratio 4:5:6. What are the three intervals in this triad? This is the triad that Ptolomy liked.<BR>
b) Notes in the ratio 3:4:5 also make up a triad. What are the three intervals in this triad?<BR>
c) (Not required, not for credit) What musical chord does this correspond to?</LI>

<LI><B>Medieval woodcut<BR>
</B>Look at the lower left-hand panel in the woodcut describing the Pythagorean ratios.<BR>
a) First assume that the numbers give the relative LENGTHS of the strings. Give the interval of the string (6) through (16) with respect to string (4).<BR>
b) Now interpret the drawing literally - that is, the numbers give the relative WEIGHTS on the strings. Again, give the interval that the strings (6) through (16) in that order make with respect to string (4). If the frequency is exactly equal to an interval that we know, give the name of the interval. Otherwise, give the ratio with three decimal points (for example 1.234).</LI>
