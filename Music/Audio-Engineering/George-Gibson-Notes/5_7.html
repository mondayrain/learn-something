<B><LI>Interference with light waves.<BR>
</B>So far, we have only considered interference effects with sound waves. However, the results we derived can be applied to any wave, including light waves. The only difference is that the speed of the wave will now correspond to the speed of light, v = 3x10<SUP>8</SUP> meters/second. The relations f<FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT> = v and R<SUB>2</SUB> - R<SUB>1</SUB> = yL/D still apply. Making two sources of light to interfere is not quite as easy as setting up to speaker. However, we can use the following set-up:<BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section5_7/382x284xImage206.gif.pagespeed.ic.4x6Lf8H2rg.png" WIDTH=382 HEIGHT=284><BR>
Two slits separated by a distance D create the two sources of light. If the wavelength of light is 600&nbsp;nm (600x 10<SUP>-9</SUP> m), the slit separation is 0.5 cm and the distance L to the screen is 1 m, what is the separation of the points of constructive interference.</LI>

<B><LI>Interference with light waves.<BR>
</b>We want to use interference patterns to measure the wavelength of a beam of light with the following setup:<BR>

a) The two light waves that interfere are formed by two slits in a mask with a separation of 0.2 mm.  (1 mm = 10<SUP>-3</SUP> meters).  If we measure the interference pattern 2.3 meters away from the mask and find that the spots of constructive interference are 4.5 mm apart, what is the wavelength of the light?<BR>
b) If the separation of the slits is made smaller by a factor of 1.5, what would be the separation of the spots of constructive interference?</LI>

<B><LI>Soap bubbles.</B><BR>
While making soap bubbles you notice that with the light behind you , the reflected light from the soap bubble looks green. How thick is the soap film? (Green light is around 530 nm).</LI>

</B>The eye can see over a range of wavelengths from about 400 nm to 700 nm. (1 nm = 10<SUP>-9</SUP> m). We want to design the antireflection coating for the wavelength right in the middle of this range.<BR>
a) What is the middle wavelength, and how thick should the coating be to create <I>destructive</I> interference in the reflected waves at this wavelength?<BR>
b) For the thickness determined in part a), what wavelength will show <I>constructive</I> interference?<BR>
c) The antireflection coating is actually effective from about (4/3)</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to (3/4)</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> , where </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is the design wavelength in part a). Does this range cover the range that the eye can see?</LI>

<B><LI>Radio waves.</B><BR>
a) Your favorite radio station uses a frequency of 104.1 MHz. What wavelength does this correspond to?<BR>
b) If you are standing near a wall, your radio will pick up the direct signal from the station, as well as a reflection from the wall. How close to the wall would you have to be to find destructive interference?</LI>

<B><LI>Cavity modes of a laser.<BR>
</B>Cavity modes of lasers are very similar to the acoustic cavities that we have been working with. However, there are some differences.<BR>
a) Consider a one dimensional cavity of light with a length of 50 cm. If the boundary conditions are the same as a closed-closed acoustic cavity, what is the frequency and wavelength of the fundamental mode?<BR>
b) This fundamental mode has a much lower frequency than the light generated by the cavity. If the light has a wavelength of 500 nm, what is the frequency of the light? What mode will this correspond to? (The mode number will be very large).</LI>

<B><LI>Gratings.<BR>
</B>If we have a grating whose groove spacing is 10<SUP>-6</SUP> meters at an angle of 25</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>Â°</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> , what wavelength of light will be reflected straight back along the horizontal direction?<BR>

<B><LI>Gratings<BR>
</B>a) A grating has 300 steps/mm. What is the distance between steps, d?<BR>
b) You shine a laser with a wavelength of 630 nm at the grating. At what angle will the light reflect straight back at you?<BR>
c) At how many different angles will this happen?<BR>

</B>Once again, we have a grating to reflect light. This time we want to know which angles of the grating will not reflect any light straight back.<BR>
a) In symbols, write down the path difference, R<SUB>2</SUB>&nbsp;-&nbsp;R<SUB>1</SUB>, between two waves which reflect off of two adjacent grooves.<BR>
b) In symbols, write down the general condition for having destructive interference. Remember, you can always add multiples of the wavelength.<BR>
c) Now, set these expressions equal. If d = 6x10<SUP>-7</SUP> meters, and <FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>l</FONT> = 530x10<SUP>-9</SUP> meters, what angles will give destructive interference? (There are only two such angles.)</LI>
