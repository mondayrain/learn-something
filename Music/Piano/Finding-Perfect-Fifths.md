# Finding Perfect Fifths

To get a perfect fifth, you want to go up 3 whole steps + a half-step.

There's a trick to quickly finding the perfect fifth of a chord on a piano:
- If it's a white key, you want to skip 3 white keys and just hit the next white key (e.g. C-G, D-A, E-B)
- If it's a black key, you want 2 black keys in between and just hit the next black key

**Caveat**: If it's B or Bb, this isn't going to work! In that case, just go up the extra half-step for B and down a half-step for Bb. This is because of the positions of the sharps :D
