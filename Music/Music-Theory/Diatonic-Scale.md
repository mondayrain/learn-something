# Diatonic Scale

A **diatonic scale** is a **heptatonic scale** (a scale that has 7 pitches per octave) that includes 5 whole tones and 2 semitones in each octave.

The rule for a diatonic scale is that the two half-steps must be separated from each other by either **2** or **3** whole steps, depending on their position in the scale. This means that when the scale spans more than an octave, all the half-steps are as far apart from each other as possible. 

Hence, all diatonic scales can be represented by a succession of Tones and Semitones. For example, the Major Scale can be represented as T-T-S-T-T-T-S, while hte Minor Scale is represented as T-S-T-T-S-T-T.

The whole collection of diatonic scales can be divided into seven different scales; these scales are called **modes**.

### Properties of a Diatonic Scale

The 7 pitches of any diatonic scale can be found by chaining 6 perfect fifths.
For example, the 7 natural pitches that for C-major can be found from stacking perfect 5ths starting from F:

F-C-G-D-A-E-B

Any sequence of seven successive **natural** (non sharp/flat) notes (and any transposition of it) is a diatonic scale. In fact, musical keyboards are _designed_ to play diatonic scales, with their lower white keys. In fact, the upper (black) keys were only added later!

### Relationship with Western Music Theory

Western music theory and Western music notation were conceived with the diatonic scale in mind!
