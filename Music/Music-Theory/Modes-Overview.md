# Scale Modes (Overview)

A **scale** is any way of dividing up the notes from the root note to the octave above.

The difference between e.g. major and minor scales is just the distance between intervals, and there are consistent rules about those intervals.

"Major" and "Minor" are **modes**. The technical mode names for them are **ionian** and **aeolian**.

### Modes

Since there are 6 different (non-flat) notes on a scale, there are 7 "modes". A **mode** is an alternative way to play a scale that gives it a different tone. For example, you can play the C scale in Ionian (aka Major) mode, Aeolian (aka minor) mode, and a bunch of other modes (overviewed below).

Modes can be derived from the familiar major scale (which has a certain key signature) by starting on a different scale degree than the root note and playing it with the same intervals (e.g. starting on the 3rd note after C).

eg.
So for example, if you wanted to play the C scale in all its modes, you would get this:

Ionian (Major): C D E F G A B C

Dorian: D E F G A B C D

....

....

Aeolian: A B C D E F G A

and so on, and so forth.

### How to write in a mode

Since all modes contain the same set of notes, how would we actually compose a piece in that "mode"?

A certain mode can be achieved by creating a section which _resolves_ to/is based on the **tonic** of that mode. The tonic is the note that we start on: note that in a non-Ionian (Major) mode, the root note is no longer the tonic.

### Mode Overview

**Ionian**

Also the same as the major scale we're all acquainted with!

**Dorian**

Almost like the ordinary "minor", but not quite: the 7th note is a half-step lower than the leading tone of the minor scale. This makes the 7th no longer "resolve" to the tonic, and gives the piece a "kick"

Has an oriental/earthy feeling.

Examples:
_Fete_  by Debussey

_Scarborough Fair_ by Simon & Garfunkel

_Eleanir Rigby_ by The Beatles

_Wicked Game_ by Chris Isaak

**Phrygian**

Minor mode that also has a lowered 7th like the Dorian. However, it also has the 2nd degree lowered by a semitone.

It also has an "oriental"/sad quality. It's often used in Spanish music: it's also known as the **Spanish gypsy scale** because it sounds a lot like the scales found in Flamenco music (though it's not the same).

Examples:

_War_ by Joe Satriani

_Jefferson Airplane_ by White Rabbit

_Hava Nagila_ Israeli Folk Song (covered by Ben Folds)

**Lydian**

Major mode where the 5th note is a half-tone higher than the major.
This can give it a "comical" quality, like a wrong note is being played, although it can also be used seriously. Mozart used it, and it has also been used in roman catholic chants.

Poland is one of the main breeding grounds for the Lydian mode, which means it was used quite a bit by Chopin. If used correctly, it can be fresh and sharp rather than comical.

Examples:

_Mazurka in F Major_ by Chopin

_An Uncertain Future_ by James Horner (for The Spitfire Grill soundtrack)

_How I Miss You_ by the Foo Fighters

_Prelude en Mode Lydique_ by Alexei Stachinsky

**Mixolydian**
Major mode with the 7th a half-step lower (so, like the Dorian and Phyrigian, we lose the leading tone). It is also called _the dominant scale_ and can be thought of as the "alternative" major sound. It has the dominant chord sound.

Jazz uses this a _lot_. It can also be found in church music still.

Examples:

_You Really Got Me_ by The Kinks

_Royals_ by Lorde

_Norwegian Wood_ by the Beatles

**Aeolian**

The "natural minor" mode: it's ubiquitous in minor-key music.

It's worth noting that there isn't just "one" minor: there is melodic and harmonic minor too!

**Locrian**

Since it uses the 7th scale as the tonic, it is very "unsatisfying". Hardly any music is written in it.

_Army of Me_ by Bjork
