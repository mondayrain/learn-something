# Classical Music Forms

Short descriptions of some common music forms during the Western Classical/Rennaisance era.

### Symphony

A large-scale work for a full orchestra, which usually consists of 4 movements:

1) An opening sonata or allegro

2) A slow movement, such as adagio

3) A minuet or scherzo with trio

4) An allegrom rondo, or sonata

Of course, variations of this lyout (like changing the order of the middle movements or adding a slow introduction to the first movement) are common.

**Examples**:
_Symphony No. 5_ by Beethoven


### Concerto
Also a large-scale work for a full orchestra, but also adds an instrumental soloist that will do a give-and-take with the orchestra.

The soloist is _usually_ piano, violin, or cello (e.g. you'll have a piano concerto)

### Suite

A collection of short, ordered musical pieces (usually dances) to form a larger work. Can be for an orchestra or a solo instrument

The **dance suite** was a very important musical form during the Baroque era, but fell out of favour in the 18th century, giving way to the symphony, sonata, and concerto. It was revived in the later 19th century, but in a different form, often presenting extracts from ballet, opera, film, or video game.

### Opera
Large scale pieces that are a mixture of music & theatre. Usually contains a full orchestra, solo singers, and a choir.

### Chamber
Small group of performers (1-6) performing for a small group if listeners.
