# Chord Basics

Every chord has 2 parts:

1) **The Root Note**: the note that we measure everything else against

2) **The Chord Quality**: tells you what the other notes in the chord are going to be

### Chord Quality

The chord quality doesn't tell you exactly what the notes are going to be though; they just tell you how far away they're going to be from the root note (a.k.a. the **interval**).

A **Simple Chord** / **Triad** has 3 notes in it.`

### Example: Major Chord

If we have an Fmaj triad, then it means that you start at root note F, and the next note up is a major 3rd interval (2 whole-steps up from the root). The third note is a perfect fifth (3 whole teps and a half-step). This gives us FAC.

If we have a perfect 5th, why isn't it called Fmaj3Per5?
- Because most chords are going to have a perfect 5th; if it's _NOT_ a perfect 5th, _then_ the chord name will tell you
- We can assume the middle note will be a third; the quality of the 3rd is told to us by the name of the chord (F _major_)

So, above we have the definition of a major chord. This is true for all major chords, regardless of root note!

### Example: Minor Chord

**Most intervals have 2 versions**: major and minor. So, with the minor chord, we want a minor 3rd and a perfect 5th (e.g. there are also major/minor 2, 4th, etc). **Minors** are always just a half-step down from the major note.

So for Fmin, we're going to get F Ab C.

**All chord qualities will have rules like this, which you apply to a root note**.

### Example: Diminished Chords

A diminished chord is usually denoted with a small circle to the top right of the root note, or bu appending "dim" to the root (e.g. Adim).

With a diminished chord, **the dim is actually referring to the 5th!**.

So, for Adim, we have A, some third, and a diminished 5th.
Like a minor, a **diminished 5th** is just a half-step down from a perfect fifth.

But what is our third? If we want to keep our current _inversion_, there is really only one choice is the minor third (since the major third would be too close to the note above).

So for Adim, we end up with A C Eb.

### Why not call it a minor 5th?
 The 5th isn't going to change that often (it's usually perfect), but the other ones (like the 3rd) change a lot. So, we think of the 5th as _perfect_ and it's more unusual hence the name.

### Example: Augmented Chords

An augmented chord is usually denoted with a **+** or an aug postfix. (e.g. G+ or Gaug)
Again, this augmented is referring to the 5th. It means the 5th is _back_ a half-step.
