# Scale Degrees

A **scale degree** is a special name given to a note on a scale, to specify its position relative to the main note of the scale. For example, if the scale is C Major, the main note (the _tonic_) is C.

Here are the names for each degree on a scale:

1 - **Tonic**

2 -  **Supertonic**

3 -  **Mediant**

4 -  **Subdominant**

5 -  **Dominant**

6 -  **Submediant**

7 -  **Leading Tone** (in Major scale) /  **Subtonic** (in Minor scale)

On a musical score, a scale degree is often shown by a number with a caret (^) on top of the number.
