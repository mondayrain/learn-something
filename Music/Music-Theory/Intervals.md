# Intervals

**Interval** is the distance between 2 notes. The basic intervals are: Unison, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and octave.

Each interval can be **raised** or **lowered**. This lets us divide intervals into 2 groups:

**Perfect intervals**: Unison, 4th, 5th, and Octave

Perfect intervals have nice, small integer frequency rations in **Pythagorean tuning** (a tuning system by Greek mathematician Pythagoras). They're _traditionally_ considered the most consonant intervals:

P1 = 1:1
P8 = 2:1
P5 = 3:2
P4 = 4:3

When a perfect interval is raised by a half-step, it's called an **augmented** interval. If lowered by a half-step, it's called a **diminished** interval.

**Major/Minor intervals**: 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th

Major/minor intervals have more complex ratios:

M2 = 9:8
m7 = 16:9

and so on and so forth. These intervals are by default referred to as "major" when untouched; if they are lowered by a half-step, then they are minor.

### More on Perfect Intervals

A **perfect interval** identifies the distance between the first note of the major scale and the unison ("perfect unison"/"perfect prime"), 4th, 5th, or octave. You can also denote them as PU/PP/P1, P4, P5, and P8.

The label of "perfect" describes the interval's _quality_. The reason why they're called "perfect" is historical: the modern Western music system has been inherited from some groundwork set by Pythagoras. To Pythagoras and many Greeks at the time, certain intervals sounded very pleasing to the ear. Mathematically, perfect intervals are also **superparticular ratios** ((n+1)/n = 1 + (1/n)) or **multiples**. Pythagoras loved mathematical perfection, so that's probably why he liked the intervals so much. It's unsure who exactly came up with the name "perfect", but the assumption is that it originates from Pythagoras (and the greeks) deeming them to be perfect.

Since Pythagoras thousands of tuning systems have been developed in the West, most of which tried to preserve the perfect 4th, 5th, and octave while allowing wiggle room for other intervals to fit together in scales (this is not generally true across all cultures).
