# Hailstone Sequences & the Collatz Problem

The **Collatz Conjecture** or **Collatz Problem** is a _conjecture_ (a proposition for which no proof has been found) named after **Lothar Collatz**. Other names for it are _the 3n+1 conjecture_, the _Syracuse problem_, and a bunch of other names.

The sequence of numbers involved in the problem is referred to as the **hailstone sequence**, or **hailstone numbers**. This is because the values are usually subjected to ups and downs, like hailstones in a cloud.

### Conjecture Summary

- Take any positive integer **n**

- If n is even, divide it by 2 (n/2)

- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (3n+1)

- Repeat the process (sometimes called **Half Or Triple Plus One**) indefinitely

The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you'll always eventually reach 1.

### Current State of Conjecture

As of now, the Collatz Conjecture still hasn't been proven.

It has been checked by computers up to at least 5.8 * 10^18 numbers, which would suggest that it's true... but doesn't actually prove that it is.

### Why is it important?

It's been posited that the Collatz conjecture is **the** simplest open problem in mathematics. It can be explained to children, non-mathematical friends, etc. However, it still can't be proved.

The lack of connection between the conjecture and mathematical theories points to an inadequacy of our mathematical theories. In fact, the conjecture has led directly to theoretical work showing that similar questions are formally undecideable.
