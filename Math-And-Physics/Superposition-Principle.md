# Superposition Principle

Simply put, the **superposition principle** or **superposition property** states that in a linear system, the net reponse caused by 2 or more stimuli is the sum of responses that would have bene caused by each stimulus individually.

Mathematically:

F(x1 + x2) = F(x1) + F(x2)

F(ax) = aF(x)

for a scalar a. These properties are called **additivity** and **homogeneity**, respectively.

Note: **a linear function is one that satisfies the properties of superposition**. That is, if a system or function is linear, it _must_ support superposition.

### Why do we care?

The principle has lots of applications in physics and engineering, because many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems... and linear systems are easier to analyze mathematically than other systems. There are lots of mathematical techniques that have been developed for working on linear systems (e.g. Fourier, Laplace, etc)!

### Application Notes

Superposition applies to _any_ linear system, including algebraic equations, linear differential equations, and systems of equations in those forms.

The stimuli and responses can be numbers, functions, vectors, time-varying signals, etc. For example, in Fourier analysis, the stimulus is written as the superposition of infinitely many sine waves. Due to the superposition principle, each sine wave can be analyzed separately.
